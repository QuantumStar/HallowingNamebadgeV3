# HallowingNamebadgeV3
This is a program I wrote so conference atendees can use their Hallowing as a name badge. Background, border, and text color can be changed with the capacitive touch 'teeth' at the bottom. One of the teeth also draws a bunch of random round squares on the background color for an interesting effect. I haven't used these libraries before, and I'm sure the code could be optimized, but, it works! The capacitive touch sensors do seem less sensitive as the LiPo battery depletes, something I have to investigate later.

Feel free to use this, if you find it helpful!
